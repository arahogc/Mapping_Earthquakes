# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary 

This project was to use a combination of JSON data, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to be able to create an interactive web-based map to be see the different kind of earthquakes that occured within the last seven days. 

This project was also used to practice branching and merging code, so that way others can view and comment and/or work on code issues before merging to the main branch.
